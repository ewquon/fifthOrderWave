fenton1985.py : Given the wave period and height, calculate relevant quantities

velocity_field.py : Given the wave period and height, plot velocity fields

max_velocities.py : Given the wave period and height, calculate the maximum x-velocity assuming it occurs at the wave crest and the maximum z-velocity on the wave free surface

NOTES

- in all cases, the depth is assumed to be a hard-coded constant, d=4.0 m
